You have just made a MAJOR update of MetaPIGA (version 2.1) now also implementing PROTEIN models and multiple new features (see below). Please, check the extended manual available in the 'help' menu, in the metaPIGA folder on your hard drive, and at http://www.metapiga.org.

The major additional new features in version 2.1 are:

- Faster processing, reduced memory requirements;
- Protein models (GTR20, Poisson, and empirical models such as WAG, JTT, DAYHOFF, VT, BLOSUM62, CPREV, MTREV, RTREV and MTMAM);
- AIC (+AICc) and BIC model testing for protein data (model testing was already available for DNA data);
- Standard binary dataset support (GTR2: 2 states model : 0,1);
- Ancestral-state reconstruction using conditional likelihood values;
- New meta-heuristic (random-restart hill climbing);
- Dataset quality control: detecting identical sequences, and excessively divergent and/or ambiguous sequences;
- The possibility for automated alignment trimming using the trimAl algorithm (Capella-Gutierrez et al., Bioinformatics 2009 25: 1972-1973): removal of excessively gapped and/or divergent columns;
- Multiple new functionalities (multiple files drag and drop, possibility to use FASTA files, choice of the models to compare in AIC and BIC model testing, sufficient and necessary stop conditions, extended and improved functions in the TreeViewer, ...);
- SourceForge support (general support, forum, bug reports, feature requests trackers, and a mailing list).

Bug corrections are:
- Resolved "freezing" issues that could happen with multi-processors analyses;
- Improved consensus-tree generation;
- Resolved memory leak problems during model testing;
- Many others.

Please check the "Change Log" (in the help menu) for a full list of changes.

ENJOY !
